This is repository hosting code used to generate data for article with title "Learning accelerates the evolution of slow aging but obstructs negligible senescence" the preprint of the article is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.24.525295v1

## Running C++ code

Running C++ code can be tricky. On windows, you will need to install a C++ compiler (see https://www.mingw-w64.org/). To run the code for generating the fitness landscapes, you need a library called libIntegrate. The corresponding directory should contain a built version of this library, if it doesn't work, you will maybe need to build it again yourself (see https://github.com/CD3/libIntegrate#installing). To run the code, you might also need to install the boost library (see https://www.boost.org/users/download/)
