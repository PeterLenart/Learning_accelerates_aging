## Running C++ code

Running C++ code can be tricky. On windows, you will need to install a C++ compiler (see https://www.mingw-w64.org/). To run the code for generating the fitness landscapes, you need a library called libIntegrate. The corresponding directory should contain a built version of this library, if it doesn't work, you will maybe need to build it again yourself (see https://github.com/CD3/libIntegrate#installing). To run the code, you might also need to install the boost library (see https://www.boost.org/users/download/)
